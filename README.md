WATTS (Workflow and Template Toolkit for Simulation) provides a set of Python
classes that can manage simulation workflows for multiple codes where
information is exchanged at a coarse level. For each code, input files rely on
placeholder values that are filled in based on a set of user-defined parameters.

WATTS is being developed with support from Argonne National Laboratory. For any
questions, please contact [watts@anl.gov](mailto:watts@anl.gov).
