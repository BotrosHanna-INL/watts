# 1App_GCMat

## Purpose

This example provides a demonstration for using WATTS to explore supply chain dynamics and uncertainty with GCMat under nuclear scenarios of Uranium fuel demand growth or shrinkage, supply disruptions.

## Code(s)

- GCMat
- Java (GCMat dependency)
- Repast Simphony agent-based modeling toolkit

## Keywords

- Rare Earths Supply Chain 
- Agent Based Modeling
- Dynamic economic markets 

## File descriptions

- [__watts_exec.py__](watts_exec.py): WATTS workflow for this example. This is the file to execute to run the problem described above.
- [__gcmat_template__](gcmat_template.txt): Templated GCMat model for the Uranium demand of nuclear scenarios.
