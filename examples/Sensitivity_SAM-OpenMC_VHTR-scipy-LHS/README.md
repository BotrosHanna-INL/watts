# Sens_SAM-OpenMC_VHTR-scipy-LHS

## Purpose

This example provides a demonstration on how to use WATTS to perform a sensitivity study through the `SciPy` algorithms based on Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) approach running SAM followed by OpenMC.

## Code(s)
 
- SAM
- OpenMC
- [__SciPy__](https://scipy.org)

## Keywords
 
- Sensitivity study with `SciPy`
- LHS
- Information transfer from SAM to OpenMC
- Simple VHTR model

## File descriptions

- [__watts_exec.py__](watts_exec.py): Sensitivity definition with `SciPy`. This is the file to execute to run the problem described above.
- [__openmc_template__](openmc_template.py): Link to OpenMC templated model.
- [__watts_main__](watts_main.py): Link to main watts model that contains the WATTS workflow.
