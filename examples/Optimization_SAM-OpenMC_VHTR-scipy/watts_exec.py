This example demonstrates how to use WATTS to perform 
optimization study by running SAM followed by OpenMC workflow. 
This example uses the same simple VHTR unit-cell as 1App examples
model with 1 coolant channel surrounded by graphite and fuel.
The SciPy library is used to drive the optimization. A single
criteria (fitness function) for this optimization study
to minimize both excess reactivity and peak fuel temperature.
The fuel pin and coolant radius are being varied by the optimization 
algorithm. The best solution is being returned.
